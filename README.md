# Paleen

1. Name of the Game: Paleen (Palindrome+Queens)

2. Introduction : It is a 2 round Game.
    a) 1st round is a game of anagram of a palindrome generation from a random string given to the user.
    b) 2nd round is a game of n-queens implementation for 4x4 grid.

3. Aim: We aim that at the end of the Paleen, the user gets adequate knowledge about what is a plaindrome and its generation logics 
The user also gets knowledge about the knowledge of n queens algorithm.

4. Procedure: 
Round 1: Computer plays against user. User is given with a string. The final target is to generate an anagram of a palindrome by removing one letter at a time. If the User wins, he proceeds to the next Round, else the game terminates.

Round 2: There is a grid of 4x4. User will be given 4 objects which are to be placed in the grid such that each column and row should have an object. Constraint is that if there is an object in a row, user cannot place the next object int the row, column and diagonals of the current object's location.

5. Data Structures used:
    1.Arrays
    2.Matrix
